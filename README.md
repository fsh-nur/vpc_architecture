# What is a VPC

- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables us to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that we've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that we operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS. If your company handles sensitive data and requires high levels of security, a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) may be the right solution for you.


- A private cloud within a public cloud

- This isolation (within the public cloud) is possible due to the assignment of a private IP subnet and the construction of encrypted user communications.


# Benefits 

1) Space Savings
By migrating your services to the cloud, you don’t have to worry about software management and upgrades. Also, you don’t have to worry about maintaining the servers on your premises.

2) High Security
As we mentioned earlier, only the authenticated user has access to the information present in the VPC.

3) Easy Integration
A VPC can work in sync with other VPCs, a public cloud, or local infrastructures.


4) Seamless Updates
With users all on the same hardware, VPC’s distributor has an easier time performing upgrades with less downtime.


# What is an internet gateway

-An Internet gateway is a network "node" that connects two different networks that use different protocols (rules) for communicating. In the most basic terms, an Internet gateway is where data stops on its way to or from other networks. Thanks to gateways, we can communicate and send data back and forth with each other.

# Subnetworks

- A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network inside a network. Subnets make networks more efficient. Through subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination.

# CIDR Block

- Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a group of IP addresses that are allocated to the customer when they demand a fixed number of IP addresses.

- In CIDR there is no wastage of IP addresses as compared to classful addressing because only the numbers of IP addresses that are demanded by the customer are allocated to the customer.

# Route Table

- A Route Table is used to direct traffic in/out of a subnet. It contains a number of CIDRs (IP address ranges) and where to direct the appropriate traffic.
